# capstone_1_proposal

### Proposal 1
  * Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+title_principals.csv
  * This data set has four csv files that represent information on movies, people in the film industry, ratings of different films, and top billed character names for movies. I'm thinking of investigating how the different eras of the studio system influence the existence of mid range budget films. The 90s had so many mid budget action movies, now all we get is huge Marvel tentpoles that can't even be called tentpoles bc they aren't being used to support a studios smaller movies. Along with this I'm planning on doing EDA and seeing if there are other factors that can predict budget/success of a film. *Do tall leading men actually mean a bigger box office?*

### Proposal 2
 * Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/hhs/health-insurance-marketplace
 * EDA on the health insurance marketplace. I personally like the idea of single payer and I'm interested to see if looking at this data set for a week influences my opinions.

### Proposal 3
 * V-2 Rockets: https://www.wrsonline.co.uk/big-ben-rocket-strikes/1944-v2-rocket-attacks-map/
 * "A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY." In the book *Gravity's Rainbow* by Thomas Pynchon, one of the characters, Roger Mexico, theorizes that the V-2 attacks on London follow a Poisson distribution. I wanna see if he was as full of sh$\*t as General Pudding. (Fun Fact: *Gravity's Rainbow* was rejected from the Pulitzer Prize voting committee after being unanimously recommended by the Pulitzer Jury because it features an extensive scene about Coprophilia.)

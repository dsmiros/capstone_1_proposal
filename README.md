### Proposal 1
  * Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+title_principals.csv
  * This data set has four csv files that represent information on movies, people in the film industry, ratings of different films, and top billed character names for movies. I'm thinking of investigating how the different eras of the studio system influence the existence of mid range budget films. The 90s had so many mid budget action movies, now all we get is huge Marvel tentpoles that can't even be called tentpoles bc they aren't being used to support a studios smaller movies. Along with this I'm planning on doing EDA and seeing if there are other factors that can predict budget/success of a film. *Do tall leading men actually mean a bigger box office?*
